I'm using the telebot library for Go to create a bot for
our needs.

On it's initial commit the bot can handle test messagea /привет, answering "Сам, привет" back.
The meaning of this minimalistic conversation is: '/hello" <=> "Hello, yourself", this is actually just a test.

The final idea behind this start up is to build a Media management system for automatic publishing of short video digest
daily into the Sher community's chat group.
